# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe game based on ReactJS and Syncano

## Prolog
Computer games market is really huge and playing alone or with friend with the same room is not enough for a long time. In shops and network we can find almost infinite count of games offering multiplayer gameplay not in the same room but in different corners of the world. Creating this type of multiplayer mode is not so hard to do but only if we use proper tools. TicTacToe aplication already reflect this.

## Technical info
Visual layer was writen in React, players data and current board status is reflection of Data Objects created in Syncano platform. The Flux architecture is kept by Actions and Stores provided by Reflux.  

## Before we begin
To make this application work some steps need to be done. First you need to have Syncano account - can be created [here](https://dashboard.syncano.io/#/signup). If you already have one just go to syncano [dashboard](https://dashboard.syncano.io) and login. You will need all Classes, Data Objects etc. structure to make this app work. Fortunately Syncano provide Solutions which allow to share things like this with other developers or get ready apps form others. Solution you will need is called "TicTacToe". Go to Solution list, search for it and install. 
After solution installation you will need to create an API key. Go to instance you have install Solution, go to Api Keys section, create one and copy it. Now head to CodeBoxes™ and chose the one named "TicTacToe". Switch Tab to Config and paste Api Key you've copied before. Also fill "instanceName" field with of course your instance name. You setup with Syncano is done!
Now let's clone [this](https://github.com/hwesol13/Tic-Tac-Toe/archive/master.zip) repository. It's a visual representation of Data Objects from Syncano and some logic that controls the game, player turn or win check. After clonning you have to fill ```src/Utils/Config.js``` file with you instance name and API key.

## Connecting new players
Players playing this game are represented by Syncano Data Objects, There are only two players available for this game and every of them have ```is_connected``` field. This field is telling application if connection for next player is allowed. If both players have this field set to ```true``` application will display proper notification. After new player join the game ```connectPlayer``` Action will be called. ```Actions.connectPlayer()``` is updating Data Object ```is_connected``` field from  ```false``` to ```true```. 

```connectPlayer``` action: 
```js
import Reflux from 'reflux';
import Connection from '../Utils/Connection';
import Config from '../Utils/Config';

  ... 

let Actions = Reflux.createActions({
  connectPlayer: {
    children: ['completed', 'failure'],
    asyncResult: true
  },
  
  ...
  
});
Actions.connectPlayer.listen((currentPlayerId) => {
  Object.assign(playersParams, {id: currentPlayerId});
  Connection.DataObject.please().update(playersParams, {is_connected: true})
    .then(Actions.connectPlayer.completed)
    .catch(Actions.connectPlayer.failure);
});
```

## Fetching initial data
First of all let's talk about components. I'm not going to talk about every single component because the most of them  - if you know React even basics - are really simple and almost the same - take `props` and show them in proper place. But one of them is more complecated and need special attention - `Board.jsx`. It joins most of other components inside and hold some simple logic like calling update Data Objects.
```ComponentWillMount``` method calls 3 ```Actions```: ```fetchBoard```, ```enableBoardPoll``` and ```enablePlayersPoll``` which properly download ```Data Objects```, start listening on changes in ```Data Objects``` holding board data and start listening on changes in ```Data Objects``` holding players inforamtions. Beacouse those ```Actions``` download data and ```Stores``` listening for ```Actions``` save this data inside of themselves and than trigger data into component, we  will see ready board when component is ready.

```ComponentWillMount``` method: 
   
```js
componentWillMount() {
  Actions.fetchBoard();
  Actions.enableBoardPoll();
  Actions.enablePlayersPoll();
}
```

```fetchBoard``` action:

```js
import Reflux from 'reflux';
import Connection from '../Utils/Connection';
import Config from '../Utils/Config';

  ... 

let Actions = Reflux.createActions({
  fetchBoard: {
    children: ['completed', 'failure'],
    asyncResult: true
  },
  
  ...
  
});

let boardParams = {
  instanceName: Config.instanceName,
  className: Config.boardClassName
};

  ...

Actions.fetchBoard.listen(() => {
  Connection.DataObject.please().list(boardParams)
    .then(Actions.fetchBoard.completed)
    .catch(Actions.fetchBoard.failure);
});
```

```enableBoardPoll``` and ```enablePlayersPoll``` actions: 

```js 
Actions.enableBoardPoll.listen(() => {
  Connection.Channel.please().get(channelParams)
    .then(Actions.enableBoardPoll.completed)
    .catch(Actions.enableBoardPoll.failure);
});

Actions.enablePlayersPoll.listen(() => {
  Object.assign(channelParams, {name: 'tictactoeplayers'});
  Connection.Channel.please().get(channelParams)
    .then(Actions.enablePlayersPoll.completed)
    .catch(Actions.enablePlayersPoll.failure);
});
```
Now when players are connected and we have data fetched we can see what is happening after player click on some field on board (```handleFieldClick``` method). Well, the clicked field is updated in Syncano via ```updateFileld``` action and turn is switched via ```switchTurn``` action. If you look at ```Data Objects``` in ```tictactoeplayers``` class you will noticed that there is a field named ```is_player_turn```. In ```updateFiled``` action call this field is updated in both objects to simulate switching turn. As you can see there is ```setState``` method inside which is updating clicked field value localy to avoid waiting user for appearing value after API call is done. It will be updated also after call is finished. User will not see this but the opponent does.

```js
handleFieldClick(dataObjectId, index) {
  let state = this.state;
  let value = state.turn;

  if (state.items[index].value === null) {
    state.items[index].value = value;
    this.setState(state, () => {
    });
    Actions.updateField(dataObjectId, value);
    Actions.switchTurn(state.currentPlayer.id, state.opponent.id);
  }
}
```

Not it's time to look on the opponent site and know how will he see the response on our click. To understand this we have to look into ```Store``` and find method named ```onEnableBoardPollCompleted``` and ```onEnablePlayersPollCompleted```. We can see that when some update on ```Data Objects``` appears proper action fetching ```Data Objects``` will be called. This will update whole board and opponent will see changes on his board. 

Actions enabling listening on ```Data Objects``` changes: 
  
```js
onEnableBoardPollCompleted(channel) {
  let poll = channel.poll();

  poll.on('message', () => {
    Actions.fetchBoard();
  });
},

onEnablePlayersPollCompleted(channel) {
  let poll = channel.poll();

  poll.on('message', () => {
    Actions.fetchPlayers();
  });
}
```

When you look on ```renderFields``` method you will see that field can be disabled (unable to be clicked and put symbol inside) in a few cases. Let's focus on one which is checking if it is our turn. Do you remember ```switchTurn``` action? Yeah! It's updating players ```Data Objects``` and because we have enabled listening on those objects changes both clients will be noticed about changes and only opponent will be able to click fields.

## Checking winner
Every game should have a winner! Fortunately the rules of this game are not complicated so we can define all winning cases.

Winning combinations

```js 
winCombinations: [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [0, 4, 8], [2, 4, 6]],
```

Each array element contains array with indexes of board which filled with the same values makes player win.
 
Example for ```[0, 3, 6]```: 
```js
X  -  -
X  -  -
X  -  -
```

Checking winning combinations method: 

```js
checkWinner() {
  let items = this.data.items; // Data Objects fetched from 'tictactoe' Syncano class 
  let currentPlayer = this.data.currentPlayer; // Data Object representing current player

  this.data.winCombinations.some((comb) => { // iterate over winning combinations
    let testArr = [items[comb[0]].value, items[comb[1]].value, items[comb[2]].value]; // 3 board values with indexes from current winning combination 

    if (currentPlayer && this.isWinner(testArr)) {
      let winner = _.find(this.data.players, ['play_as', testArr[0]]);

      Actions.setWinner(winner.id); // mark player as winner in Syncano
      comb.forEach((index) => {
        this.data.items[index].color = '#F44336'; // mark winning fields in other color 
      });
    }
  });
  this.data.isGameOver = this.isGameOver(); // helper value representing finished game
  this.trigger(this.data); // trigger data into listening components
},

isWinner(items) {
  let first = items[0];

  if (items.every((item) => item === null) || this.data.winner) {
    return false;
  }

  return items.every((item) => { // check if every item from test array is equal to first - true means that we have a winner
    return item === first;
  });
},
```

## Disconnectiong players
Allright, we finished playing and we want to let others to play this game. No problem! The solution you have instaled at the beginning contains Schedule which trigger CodeBox™ every 5 minutes. This CodeBox™ is checking players activity and if any player didn't make move from 5 minutes will be disconnected.

CodeBox™ cleanning inactive players

```js 
var Moment = require('moment');
var _ = require('lodash');
var Syncano = require('syncano');
var connection = new Syncano({apiKey: CONFIG.apiKey, instance: CONFIG.instanceName});

connection.class(CONFIG.className).dataobject().list().then(function(resp) {
  var players = resp.objects;

  _.forEach(players, function(player) {
    var lastActivity = player.updated_at;

    if (Moment(Date.now()).diff(lastActivity, 'minutes') > 5) {
      connection.class(CONFIG.className).dataobject(player.id).update({is_connected: false}, function(resp) {
        console.log(player.name + ' disconnected...');
      })
    }
  });
})
```


## Summary
I'm sure you would ask me why only 2 payers can play this game. Don't worry :) it's will happen soon. Stay tuned and we will expand this app on new features like rooms to allow more players play game in the same time.
